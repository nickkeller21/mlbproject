      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
         <p>The main data sources fr=or our moel came from <a src='https://www.rotowire.com/baseball/stats.php'>Roto Wire</a>. We pulled 
        both the advanced and basic stats for every player in the MLB for the last six years. We needed this large dataset to train our model.
        
        We still used the WAR leaders from the previous part of our project to predict and display our data.</p>



        <h3>Cleaning Data</h3>
          <p>The biggiest issue we had with our data was that the Rookie players did not have consistant salaries. Rookie contracts are set
              by the MLB and are not able to be negtiated at a fair market value unless the teams are willing to extend the players. For our model
              we ended up excluding the majority of payers on Rookie Contracts because they would skew the projections negatively.
          </p>

            
        <h3>Model Creation and Selection</h3>
         <p>We knew that we had a regression problem so we started with the basic linear regression algorith for both the pitching and the batting
             dataset. </p>
        <p>Since we knew that the WAR value was a combination of multiple other statistics we knew that it was probably inappropriate to include 
            it in our evalution as it would correlate too strongly with other attributes and skew the results.
        </p>
        <p>Our first step after loading the data was to check for correlations. We knew that in regression models, features that were 
            highly correltated would often lead to inaccurate results. We built and charted a correlation for each dataset to visualize
            each dataset to quickly check for correlations that could be filterd out. The results are below.
        </p>

        <p>Once we had an idea of features that correlated to each other we ran the standard linear regression model to calculate feature
            importance and correlation coefficiants. The results for both are below
        </p>
        <img src ="../static/assets/images/batters_feat_corr.png"> 

        <p>Now that we had a baseline for the linear regression and which features were most important we decided to implement the Lasso 
            Regression model to try and impove accuracy by cutting down on the number of features that were included in the model. After 
            the Lasso model we had paired out features down to include only 11 of the initial 19.

        <p>
            Although the accuracy had improved we implemented the Ridge Regression model at different alpha values to try and further
            increase our accuracy. The alpha values we decided to use were .1 and .001. After running the model we found that using the high 
            alpha value improved our accuracy above the other models on both datasets so we decided to move forward with those models.
